# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Dev Commands

- **Package manager:** pnpm (v9)
- `pnpm build` — TypeScript compile (`tsc`) to `dist/`
- `pnpm start` — Run directly via `tsx src/cli.tsx` (no build needed)
- `pnpm dev` — Watch mode via `tsx --watch src/cli.tsx`
- `pnpm test` — Run vitest test suite (`tests/` directory)
- `pnpm test:e2e` — Run Docker-based E2E tests (builds containers, runs Playwright specs, exits)
- `pnpm test:e2e:build` — Pre-build Docker images without running tests
- `pnpm test:e2e:clean` — Tear down containers, remove images/volumes

## What This Is

`agent-monitor` (`am`) is a terminal UI (TUI) dashboard for monitoring multiple Claude Code agent sessions across git worktrees. Built with Ink (React for CLIs) and SQLite.

Key capabilities: live agent status tracking, GitHub PR/CI status, Linear ticket integration, worktree lifecycle management (create/delete), IDE launching, per-repo startup scripts.

## Architecture

### Entry Flow
`src/cli.tsx` uses `commander` for CLI parsing and routes to subcommands or launches the TUI (default action). Commands are organized as subcommand groups (`worktree`, `repo`, `settings`, `hooks`, `pr`, `linear`, `script`, `doctor`) with short aliases (`ls`, `new`, `open`). Each command handler lives in `src/commands/` and uses dynamic imports to avoid loading unnecessary modules. The TUI runs in a `while(true)` loop: Ink renders → user exits → unmount → run any pending startup script in raw terminal → re-launch Ink. This loop exists because Ink takes over stdin/stdout and can't coexist with interactive child processes.

### State Machine
`src/app.tsx` is the root component managing an `AppMode` string union that controls rendering:
`dashboard` → `folder-browse` → `repo-select` → `new-worktree` → `branch-exists` → `creating-worktree` → `delete-confirm` → `deleting-worktree` → `settings`

### Data Flow
1. **Agent status in:** Claude Code fires hook events → `am hook-event --worktree $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` receives JSON on stdin → writes to SQLite via `src/commands/hook-event.ts` → publishes to Unix domain socket for instant TUI update
2. **Pub/sub layer:** Unix domain socket at `~/.agent-monitor/am.sock` provides instant push updates. The TUI starts a server (`src/lib/pubsub-server.ts`, managed by `src/hooks/usePubSub.ts`), and `hook-event` publishes fire-and-forget messages (`src/lib/pubsub-client.ts`). Only one TUI can own the socket; others fall back to polling. SQLite remains the source of truth — pub/sub is an optimization to avoid polling delay. Messages are newline-delimited JSON, typed in `src/lib/pubsub-types.ts`.
3. **TUI polling:** `src/hooks/useWorktrees.ts` still polls SQLite + git status (2s default), GitHub PRs (60s), and Linear tickets (60s) as a fallback. Uses JSON fingerprinting to skip re-renders when data hasn't changed.

### Key Modules
- `src/lib/db.ts` — SQLite with WAL mode. Tables: `repositories`, `worktrees`, `agent_status`. Handles schema migrations.
- `src/lib/git.ts` — Git ops via `simple-git`. Worktree creation uses raw `git worktree` commands for `--force`/`-b` flag control.
- `src/lib/github.ts` — Shells out to `gh` CLI for PR info
- `src/lib/linear.ts` — Raw HTTPS POST to Linear GraphQL API (no SDK)
- `src/lib/hooks-installer.ts` — Writes Claude hook config to `.claude/settings.json` in worktrees
- `src/lib/settings.ts` — Loads/saves `~/.agent-monitor/settings.json`
- `src/lib/output.ts` — CLI output formatting (table, key-value, JSON) for non-TUI commands
- `src/lib/resolve.ts` — Resolves CLI targets (branch names, paths) to DB entities; CWD-based repo detection

### CLI Commands
Commands in `src/commands/` are organized by domain:
- `src/commands/worktree/` — list, create, delete, open, sync, info
- `src/commands/repo/` — list, add, remove
- `src/commands/settings/` — list, get, set, reset
- `src/commands/hooks.ts` — install, uninstall, status
- `src/commands/pr.ts` — show, open
- `src/commands/linear.ts` — show, open
- `src/commands/script.ts` — edit, remove, show
- `src/commands/doctor.ts` — system health check
- `src/commands/status.ts` — get/set agent status (unchanged)
- `src/commands/hook-event.ts` — receive hook events from stdin (unchanged)

### Persistence
All data at `~/.agent-monitor/` (or `$AM_DATA_DIR` if set): SQLite DB (`agent-monitor.db`), `settings.json`, `debug.log` (auto-rotated), `scripts/<repo-id>.sh`.

### Data Isolation (`AM_DATA_DIR`)
`src/lib/paths.ts` exports `APP_DIR` which defaults to `~/.agent-monitor/` but can be overridden via the `AM_DATA_DIR` environment variable. All other paths (`DB_PATH`, `SETTINGS_PATH`, `LOG_PATH`, `SOCKET_PATH`, etc.) derive from `APP_DIR` automatically. This enables running the app against isolated temp directories for testing without touching real user data.

## Testing

### Unit Tests (vitest)
Unit and component tests live in `tests/` mirroring the `src/` structure. Run with `pnpm test`. Uses `ink-testing-library` for React component tests. All tests use isolated `AM_DATA_DIR` temp directories.

### Docker E2E Tests
End-to-end tests run the real TUI in Docker containers with mocked external services. This is the primary way to capture visual evidence (screenshots) and test full user flows.

**Architecture:** Three Docker containers orchestrated by `e2e/docker-compose.yml`:
1. **`mock-api`** — HTTP server (`e2e/mock-api/server.ts`) that serves configurable fixtures for `gh` CLI and Linear API responses. Fixtures live in `e2e/mock-api/fixtures/`.
2. **`app`** — The real TUI served via ttyd on port 7681. Uses a fake `gh` shim (`e2e/bin/gh`) that proxies to mock-api. Entrypoint (`e2e/entrypoint.sh`) seeds a git repo and skips the setup wizard.
3. **`tests`** — Playwright container that connects to the TUI via browser, interacts with it, and captures screenshots.

**Test specs** live in `tests/e2e/docker/` and use two helpers:
- `helpers/tui-page.ts` — Page Object Model for the TUI. Methods: `goto()`, `getScreenText()` (reads xterm.js terminal buffer), `waitForText(text)`, `sendKey(key)`, `type(text)`, `screenshot(name)`.
- `helpers/mock-api-client.ts` — `setupMock({gh?, linear?})` to inject per-test fixtures, `resetMock()` in `beforeEach` for isolation.

**Existing specs and coverage:**

| Spec | What it tests |
|------|---------------|
| `dashboard.spec.ts` | Dashboard renders with seeded repo, shows repo name |
| `navigation.spec.ts` | Keyboard nav: `s`→settings, `n`→new worktree, `d`→delete |
| `pr-status.spec.ts` | Open PR, draft PR, and no-PR states (uses mock fixtures) |
| `setup-wizard.spec.ts` | Verifies wizard is skipped when settings are seeded |
| `screenshots.spec.ts` | Baseline screenshots: dashboard, settings, dashboard with PR |

**Writing new E2E specs:**
```typescript
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { TuiPage } from "./helpers/tui-page";
import { resetMock, setupMock } from "./helpers/mock-api-client";

test.beforeEach(async () => { await resetMock(); });

test("my feature works", async ({ page }) => {
  await setupMock({ gh: { number: 42, state: "OPEN" } }); // optional
  const tui = new TuiPage(page);
  await tui.goto();
  await tui.waitForText("main", 10_000);
  await tui.sendKey("s"); // navigate to settings
  await tui.screenshot("my-feature");
});
```

**Adding mock fixtures:** Add JSON files to `e2e/mock-api/fixtures/`, then use `setupMock()` to select them or pass inline objects. The mock-api routes are:
- `POST /gh` — handles gh CLI calls (args-based routing: `pr view`, `--version`)
- `POST /linear` — handles Linear GraphQL queries (viewer, issue search)
- `POST /mock/setup` — per-test fixture injection
- `DELETE /mock/reset` — restore defaults

**Running E2E tests:**
```bash
pnpm test:e2e          # Build + run + exit with test code
pnpm test:e2e:clean    # Tear down containers after
```
Screenshots land in `tests/e2e/tmp/`. New specs are automatically picked up via Dockerfile `COPY` on rebuild.

**Config:** `e2e/playwright.config.ts` — single Chromium worker, 30s timeout, 1 retry, screenshots on failure. Tests run sequentially (`workers: 1`) because they share a single TUI terminal.

## Evidence Capture & PR Workflow

### Slash Commands
- `/capture-evidence` — Spawns two parallel sub-agents: Agent A runs `pnpm test` for unit tests, Agent B runs `pnpm test:e2e` for Docker E2E tests and screenshots. Includes a coverage mapping table so Agent B knows which specs cover which components and can create new specs for gaps.
- `/create-pr` — Idempotent PR creation: detects existing PRs via `gh pr view`, runs `/capture-evidence`, then creates or updates the PR with evidence.

### Scripts (`.claude/scripts/`)
- `upload-evidence.sh [evidence-dir]` — Pushes screenshots to the `evidence-images` orphan branch. Outputs `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs. Called with `tests/e2e/tmp` as the evidence dir.
- `seed-evidence-data.sh` — **Deprecated.** For local manual debugging only. Use `pnpm test:e2e` instead.
- `capture-tui.sh` — **Deprecated.** For local manual debugging only. Use `pnpm test:e2e` instead.
- `cleanup-tui.sh` — **Deprecated.** For local manual debugging only. Use `pnpm test:e2e:clean` instead.

### GitHub API Note
`gh pr edit --body` triggers a "Projects (classic) is being deprecated" GraphQL error. Use the REST API instead:
```bash
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER" -X PATCH -f body='...'
```

## Documentation

When making changes to architecture, data flow, modules, or conventions, update this file (CLAUDE.md) and README.md to keep them in sync with the codebase.

## Logging

When adding or modifying code paths, add appropriate `log()` calls to maintain observability:
- `log("info", ...)` for key state changes (status updates, hook install/uninstall, config changes)
- `log("debug", ...)` for branching decisions, mapping logic, and detailed context (e.g. which branch was taken in `mapEventToStatus` and why)
- `log("warn", ...)` for recoverable errors or unexpected state
- Always include relevant context in log messages (event names, tool names, computed values) to aid debugging

## Conventions

- ESM (`"type": "module"`) with NodeNext module resolution
- TypeScript strict mode, all shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- React 18 JSX transform (`react-jsx`)
- Components are in `src/components/`, hooks in `src/hooks/`, core logic in `src/lib/`
- SQLite chosen over JSON files for concurrency safety (hooks write while TUI reads)
- Published to GitHub Packages as `@roylet-gs/agent-monitor`
